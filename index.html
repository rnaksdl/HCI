            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p> Welcome to KillerSale, the Point of Sale (POS) system built to help small 
                businesses streamline their operations with one application. Our mission 
                is simple: Stay Orcanized. We provide an easy-to-use solution that combines 
                powerful customer and restaurant management functionalities, all in one place.</p>

            <p> KillerSale is designed to give small businesses the tools they need to run efficiently 
                and effectively without breaking the bank. With KillerSale, you get all the essential POS 
                features, from secure payment processes to real-time analytics for absolutely no cost. 
                We believe that small businesses shouldn't have to struggle to use preexisting POS nor pay
                hundreds to thousands of dollars for a POS system, or even two, and that is why we created this platform
                and why it is free to use.</p>

            <p> <i> *KillerSale is currently still in development</i></p>
